## Time-course RNA-sequencing of human induced regulatory T cell (iTreg) differentiation
这里要用raw data，因为normaliser的data不能用于loi poisson模型;
所以如果直接拿 TPM、FPKM 等比例型数据来聚类，可能出现：高表达样本被压缩；样本间技术噪音放大；方差估计偏差 → 聚类不稳定

Comparing the gene expression in activated CD4+ cells and iTreg differentiated cells in human. 
10 time points, 3 biological replicates for each time point.

Explication of RNA-seq data:
  RNA-Seq and proteomics data from human iTregs and controls. 
  Thp:Unstimulated naïve CD4⁺ T cells.
  Th0: Mock stimulation control. ‘Mock’ control cells received no further compounds.(假刺激)
  iTreg: Induced Treg with TGF-β or others.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
